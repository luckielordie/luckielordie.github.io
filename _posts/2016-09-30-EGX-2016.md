==============

I've just got back from EGX so I thought I'd share a couple pictures from my couple of days there! It was a great day, I managed to see loads of the games I wanted to see, BF1, Titanfall 2 and Dishonoured 2 to name some. 
I even found some games I wasn't expecting to enjoy like Mainlining! Mainlining is a fun little hacking game with a WindowsXP-esque UI, I couldn't quite figure out the puzzle during my time at the booth but It's got me 
hooked enough to check it out when it releases later this year!

<ul class="photo-gallery">
  {% for image in page.images %}
    <li>
        <img src="{{ image.image_path }}"/>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
