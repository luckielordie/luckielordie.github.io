			memory allocations could be traced back to individual modules within our codebase. When I was researching methods of doing this that could be implemented into existing games
			I came across a library called Minhook. Minhook allows the user to register callbacks whenever a loaded module calls a specific Win32 API function call.",
			"In order to log every allocation I hooked the 'HeapAlloc' and 'HeapFree' calls in Win32 API and use the DbgHelp library that Microsoft provides with Windows to load symbols for 
			the code and generate a stack trace. This then allowed me to walk up the stack until I find the module that made the allocation.",
			"This was not a particularly efficient method to use, however the tool was able to generate a lot of useful data about memory allocations for every single loaded module in any one of our 
			games. The scope of this project was limited to only capturing heap data, however it could also be modified to also capture stack data in the same manor. Another application of this code
			could also be the use of custom allocation methods by routing memory allocations into pre-allocated space previously requested by the program. This would be along the same lines as my University 
			dissertation on heap memory allocation techniques."],

			The code that interacted with the games was mostly already in place, however what existed was configured via an xml file before the code was run and was not able to be interacted with during runtime.
			The requirement was to add the ability for developers to add credit to the platform while the games were running and other simulations of 'live' behaviour.",
			"In order to expose the behaviour I embedded a web server into the code that the game developers consume and allowed access to functions such as adding credit by way of a REST API provided by the web server.
			This allows a web page provided by the web server to access this API. With the UI being a web page it was also possible to make the page viewable on mobile devices and desktop devices in the web browser. The added 
			benefit of exposing the functionality this way is that devlopers can consume the functionality via the web page provided or by making cUrl requests through their own code to automate their testing procedures."],

		"post_body" : ["This project was completed as the dissertation for my degree at Stafforshire University. Its purpose was to investigate heap allocation techniques
		  and ways in which heap allocation times can be improved. The project delivered an interface for creating custom memory allocators that will work with the tools
		  for logging memory allocations, helping to identify memory leaks. It does this by taking the difference between two snapshots and presenting that to the user, they are
		  then able to determine memory leaks easier because the information is presented to them clearly. The tool also displays information about avery allocation made by the application
		  such as the size, alignment, line number and function the allocation was made on/in and the tag that was given to the allocation. Tags are sorted when the tool loads the snapshot file
		  and is able to show information about how much memory a certain tag is taking.",
		  "The main focus of the application was heap allocation however. It was found that pre-allocating the memory needed by an application can speed up memory requests since
		  the application no longer has to pause while waiting for the OS to return a memory address that can be used for the application. Pre-allocating was found to be quick when coupled with
		  allocation patterns such as the Linear Allocator and the Pool Allocator, these allocation patterns were designed to suit very specific scenarios and were chosen because of their relevance to
		  games programming. However pre-allocating has downsides since allocators generally don't have the option to grow or shrink, this leads to allocating to the worst case when memory usage can be
		  quite high in a particular part of the runtime. Patterns such as a Free List were investigated as a way to provide variable sized allocators.",

		  "Missile Mania was a project I was able to undertake when working at Mobile Pie on my placement year as part of my degree. It was written in Javascript

		"post_body" : ["This was a project in which we were split into groups of three people, given a repository and a specification. The aim of the project was to create a game engine that could be used to create a small game. The engine as a minimum must be able to render 2D or 3D environments, take user input and simulate basic physics. These requirements were split up between the members of our team and I was given the task of creating an input system that can take user input and present it in game logic in a meaningful way to a developer.",
		"The first task to overcome was to decide on how entities in the game world will be created, we decided on the Component-Entity model where game entities are represented as a set of components that give the entity behaviour. For example, an entity is given a 'Particle Physics' component, now it is able to be moved in the game world by the physics system. In our engine we paired components with a system that controlled all components in the game world of that type. When a component is added to an entity a message is sent to the appropiate system and the system creates the component, adds it to it's list of alive components and the reference returned to the entity. This concept allowed for the logic for a component to be seperated from the data the component has. For example the physics component we talked about before will only contain information about that specific components velocity and acceleration, every update loop the system for that component uses the logic for moving a particle under acceleration and the values contained in the component it's operating on.",
		"For the input module I was responsible for I set myself the following goals. New devices must be able to be added to the system by extending the code, no other changes should be nesecery to do this. The system must be general enough to allow for remapping of input by editing a data file, in other words input mapping. The idea is to seperate the logic of an action from the input required to make that action happen. For example, when the player presses A the sprite will jump, The action jump in the example is tied to the button A. Instead I opted for If the action for jump occurs then the sprite will jump In this example from the developers perspective the button required to make the jump action is irrelevent to the logic need to make the sprite jump. The input system can be configured by an XML file to map the actions (like jump) to hardware buttons, then it is the job of the input system to fire off the actions when they occur, once the action is fired the game code can respond to the action however they like. Another massive benefit to the system is that the controls for a game can be reconfigured during runtime to a players preference.",
		"While developing the project I also took on a number of smaller modules that interested me. The first was a console logging class that was able to provide information from the console in a more friendly way. This involved creating 'channels' that the developer could output to, then filter the output of the console to only show output from a certain channel. It also logged all output to text files so that in case of a crash the last logs could be recovered. The second mini project was creating a way for developers to create plugins for the game engine itself. By creating a plugin manager and exposing interfaces for the update and draw loop developers could create their own components and systems for the engine.",
		"This project was by far the favourite one I undertook during my time at Staffordshire, it gave me the freedom to explore an area of games development I am extremely interested in. Since the module this project is for is still taught at the university, I have been advised to keep the repository private. However if you contact me I will gladly give your bitbucket account priviledges."],
