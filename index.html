          <p class="lead">Hi I'm Matt! I'm currently working as a C++ Developer at<a href="http://inspiredgaminggroup.com/"> Inspired Gaming</a> in Birmingham. I am part of their Core Libraries team, we maintain the game engine and other core libraries the games teams need to create awesome games!</p>
          <p class="lead">In July 2015 I graduated from Staffordshire University with a 2-1 in BSc(Hons) Computer Games Programming. During my degree I had experience as a developer at a mobile games company called <a href="http://www.mobilepie.com/">Mobile Pie</a> and spent a year working with them and even got to develop a <a href="http://www.a10.com/action-games/missile-mania">game!</a></p>
